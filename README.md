The Book: [99 Bottles of OOP by Sandi Metz](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The book is in Ruby. This repo is for fellow pythonistas that would like to
learn more about Object Oriented Principles without the mental overhead of
understanding Ruby code.

Note: I also wanted to play around with f-strings. So this repo is compatible
for python >= 3.6

*This repo is a work in progress.*
